# Intro

This portfolio will guide you through several snippets of my work during the third software semester of FHICT (2022-2023). This repository will act as a summary of my work in this semester, along with explanations of how I proved a certain set of learning 
outcomes.

Down below I will provide you with the learning outcomes as they are at the time of writing (September 12th, 2022), with the explanation of said outcome. This will be followed with a table containing all of my work proving the outcomes.

# Learning outcomes

For a complete list of the learning outcomes and their explanation as of September 12th, 2022, see [here](/dict/learning-outcomes.md).

# Proof

Below is a table containing all of my proof, with a link to further explanation.
