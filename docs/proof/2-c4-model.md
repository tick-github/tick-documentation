# User Stories and C4 Model

## Table of Contents

- [C4 Model](#c4-model)

## Intro

At the start of the project, I had to come up with an idea, and individual user stories that come with that idea. Since this project is so open-ended, I limited myself to 4 main components:

* The frontend framework (a Javascript framework as per the requirements)
* An API to grab cached preferences and settings per user
* An API to grab cached user data linked to their Google Account
* A component to grab weather forecasts from an outside source, cache them, and return the last cached result.
  
## User Stories

With these 4 main components in mind, I started formulating the user stories.

1.  As a **student**, I want to **see the weather**.
2.  As a **student**, I want to **see my upcoming appointments**.
3.  As a **student**, I want to **personalize my application theme**.
4.  As a **student**, I want to **change the application language**.
5.  As a **student**, I want to want to be able to **view and change the core application settings** in a single, clear menu.

*This list of user stories is not final and will be subject to change. This is a snapshot from September 19, 2022.*

## C4 Model

To visualize these core components, I made use of the C4 model. The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture. I decided the visualize the second layer, the container layer.
