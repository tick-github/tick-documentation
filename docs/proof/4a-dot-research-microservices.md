## Intro

This research document will mainly focus on microservice architectures, the main problem of service discovery, and the solution Netflix Eureka provides for a Java stack.

The problem will first be laid out and explained, which will be followed by sub-questions, finally leading up to a proof of concept with the soluton integrated into it.

_This research uses various methods and strategies from the DOT Framework, mainly the "library" and "workshop" methods._ <small>[(Meesters, 2018)](#meesters-2018)</small>

## What are Microservices?

### In short

Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. <small>[(IBM Cloud Education, 2021)](#ibmcloudedu-2021)</small>

These services typically have their own technology stack and communicate with other microservices via REST APIs.

### Monolithic versus Microservices

Traditionally, applications used to be developed monolithically. This often resulted as a giant stack with tightly coupled processes running as a single service. This means that if one process experiences a spike in popularity and demand, the entire monolith needs to be scaled accordingly. As the code base grows, this become a more and more complex of a job. This complexity limits the experimentation and implementation of new ideas. A monolithic architecture also adds risk for application availability. Many processes are dependant and tightly coupled, which means an increased impact should one fail. <small>[(AWS, n.d.)](#aws-ms-nd)</small>

With a microservice architecture, a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs, such as REST. Each service typically has a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet the demand for specific application functionality. <small>[(IBM Cloud Education, 2021)](#ibmcloudedu-2021) [(AWS, n.d.)](#aws-ms-nd)</small>

## What are the benefits of using a microservices architecture?

Adding to the [previous header](#monolithic-versus-microservices), the main benefits to using a microservices architecture are:

- Microservices remove _single points of failure_ (SPOFs) by ensuring that an issue with one service, should not crash or affect other parts of the application.
- Individual microservices can be scaled independently to provide extra availability and capacity.
- Development teams can extend the functionality of an application by adding new microservices without unnecessarily affecting other parts of said application.

## What are the negatives of using a microservice architecture?

With its many positives of using microservices, there are of course some negatives as well. It is up to the development team to weigh the positives against the negatives, and choose the apropriate architecture as their solution.

- A microservice architecture incurs more complexity to get more flexibility. In a monolithic application, all the parts are in one box, so to speak. Therefore, you can declare dependencies in code and not worry too much about deployment issues. All the parts ship together at deployment time. <small>[(JavaTPoint, n.d.)](#neg-1) [(Reselman, 2022)](#neg-2) [(Nemer, 2019)](#neg-3)</small>
- Microservices are great for large companies, but can be slower to implement and too complicated for small companies who need to create and iterate quickly, and donâ€™t want to get bogged down in complex orchestration. <small>[(Nemer, 2019)](#neg-3)</small>
- More services require more resources. The footprint of a microservice can be greater than a monolithic application, depending on the use case.
- Debugging and integration testing can be especially difficult.

## How do you implement microservices in a Java stack?

For this part, a previous proof of concept will be referenced. It is a relatively simple API microservice using a service discovery and API gateway to navigate the microservice landscape.

_see [here](4-poc-dockerized-java-customer-services.md)_

There are various framework options for creating a microservices architecture in Java:

- Spring Microservices with Spring Boot <small>[(Spring, n.d.)](#springio-ms-nd)</small>
- Jersey JAX-RS REST framework <small>[(Eclipse Foundation, n.d.)](#eclipsejersey-ms-nd)</small>
- Swagger RESTful APIs <small>[(Wagner, n.d.)](#swaggerapi-ms-nd)</small>

Spring is the easiest to implement, is the Spring Boot implementation, due to its extensive documentation and easy set up. As such, Spring will be used for implementing the proof of concept.

## Conclusion

There are a couple of ways to implement a microservices architecture in a Java stack. The recommended way to implement such an architecture, is to use a framework. The simplification and abstraction that a framework supplies outweighs the DIY solutions in many cases.

In my prototyping, I used Spring Cloud coupled with Netflix Eureka to set up a simple microservices architecture, with a gateway.

Microservices have many advantages, like removing SPOFs, improved scaling and extended functionality. Disadvantages could be an increase in complexity and resources needed to run the operation. It is up to the development team to decide whether or not they need to use a microservices architecture as their solution.
