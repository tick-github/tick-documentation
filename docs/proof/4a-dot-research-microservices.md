## Intro

This research document will mainly focus about microservice architectures, the main problem of service discovery, and the solution Netflix Eureka provides for a Java stack.

The problem will first be laid out and explained, which will be followed by sub-questions, finally leading up to a proof of concept with the soluton integrated into it.

This research uses various methods and strategies from the DOT Framework [(Meesters, 2018)](#meesters-2018).

## What are Microservices?

### In short

Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. (IBM Cloud Education, 2021)
